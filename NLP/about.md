NLP is a field of AI that allows computers to understand, interpret and generate human-like data.

## An Important Note Regarding Stemming
the examples presented on the file 'stemming.py', The word "worse" gets stemmed to "wors" because the **Porter Stemmer**, implemented in the `nltk` library, uses heuristic rules to reduce words to their base or "stem" form. These rules are designed to handle a wide variety of words but do not necessarily aim for linguistic accuracy.
### Specific Reason for "worse" â†’ "wors":
1. **Porter Stemmer's Algorithm**:
    - In the context of stemming, "worse" is considered irregular. The Porter Stemmer removes suffixes or modifies words based on predefined heuristic patterns, rather than considering the linguistic structure or meaning.
    - The stemmer applies its rules without taking the comparative or superlative form into account (like "worse" being the comparative form of "bad"). Instead, it treats "worse" as a standard word and strips the "e" at the end, leaving "wors".

2. **Heuristic Nature**:
    - Stemming focuses on reducing a word for broad pattern-matching purposes, not maintaining semantic meaning. The algorithm is mechanically coded to strip suffixes based on patterns like removing trailing "e" in many words, leading to this behavior.

### Practical Implication:
If you need more accurate results (e.g., preserving the comparative and superlative forms along with semantic meaning), you might want to use **lemmatization** instead of stemming. **Lemmatization** is supported by libraries like `nltk` (using `WordNetLemmatizer`) and tends to provide linguistically meaningful base forms of words.
