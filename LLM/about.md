# What is it?
a machine that consumes massive amount of data. (books, websites, conversation)
deep learning -> neural networks -> NLP -> transformers architecture

prior to transformers we used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). it processes text sequentially
so if the input is too large, it could lose context

## features
- general purpose (wide variety of topics)
- larger compared to other models (parameters -> billions)
- ability to be -pre-trained and fine-tuned. 

## what can they do?
- content creation
- translation
- answering questions
- chatbots/virtual assistance
- sentiment analysis
- summarization
- content recommendations
- generating code
- medical diagnosis

## What is a transformer?
a modern neural network architecture that improve language processing compare to RNNs.
it PAYS ATTENTION to keywords of the input data (*attention is all you need*).
