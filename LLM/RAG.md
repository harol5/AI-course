is it more helpful to have the context in a unstructured on structured format?
Meaning, an spreadsheet or a text that describes the context (product description -> but most be very detailed)

maybe a can get some keywords from the initial prompt, then use that to retrieve the pertinent (relevant and clean) data (embeddings)
